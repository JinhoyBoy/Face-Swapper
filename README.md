# Image Processing Project
## Functionalities

The main functionality of this project is the face swapping. The user can run `faceswap.py` to input two image paths for face swapping. 

Image Processing modules such as resizing or merging, that are needed for face swapping are implemented in `image_modules.py`. 

The model for face bounding box detection was defined and trained in `train_model.py` the model was trained using datasets from kaggle.
